# 2022-prototype: the test/prototype 2022 base code

This is a project for updating/testing our swerve drive code for the MK2 to MK4
update (different encoders, max speed, geometry, etc.) and working through the
details of limelight odometry and building command queuing into the path planning
software.

A secondary goal is working out the details of creating an *a05annexRobot*
library for code that will be common to both the prototype and competition
robots as well as being a jump start in future seasons.
